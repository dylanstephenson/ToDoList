# Overview

This program loads a file or create a new file where a user can save to do tasks. The tasks have a priority of 1-3 by how important it is that they get done, and the date the task is created is also provided so the user can see how long it's been since they created the task. This program leverages classes, with the todo list being it's own class. It also utilizes for loops as the todo list is looped through to print to the console, and the options chosen whether to Add, Delete, or Exit, utilize conditional statements.

This program was created as a learning exercise to learn the basics of C++ like input and output to the console, working with variables and expressions, and then expanding to functions and loops, until eventually I created a class for the To Do List. By doing this, along with working with fstream and sstream to read and write to files, I have a solid foundation in writing code using C++.
